## Loading and preprocessing the data
```{r, echo=TRUE, results="asis"}
# Reads data from zip and csv
unzip("activity.zip")
activity <- read.csv("activity.csv")

# Shows what read data looks like
library(xtable)
head.activity <- xtable(head(activity))
print(head.activity, type="html")
```

  
## What is mean total number of steps taken per day?
```{r, echo=TRUE, results="asis"}
# 1a. Calculates the total number of steps taken per day
stepsPerDay <- with(activity, tapply(steps, date, sum, na.rm=TRUE))
head.stepsPerDay <- xtable(as.data.frame(head(stepsPerDay)))
print(head.stepsPerDay, type="html")


# 1b. Draws historgram of total number of steps taken each day
hist(stepsPerDay, 
        main = "Distribution of Total Number of Steps Per Day", 
        xlab="Steps Per Day", 
        ylab="Number of Days")
          

# 2a. Calculates and report the mean total number of 
#     steps taken per day
mean(stepsPerDay)


# 2b. Calculates and report the median total number of 
#     steps taken per day
median(stepsPerDay)
```


## What is the average daily activity pattern?
```{r, echo=TRUE, results="asis"}
# 1. Make a time series plot (i.e. type = "l") of the 5-minute interval (x-axis) 
#    and the average number of steps taken, averaged across all days (y-axis)
library("ggplot2")
library("data.table")
library("zoo")
activity <- data.table(activity)
stepsPerInterval <- activity[, byInterval:= mean(steps, na.rm=TRUE), by=list(interval)]
a<- ggplot(stepsPerInterval, aes(x=interval, y=byInterval))
a+geom_line(lwd=1)+
        ggtitle("Average Daily Activity Pattern")+
        labs(x="5-minute interval",y="Avg Number of Steps")


# 2. Which 5-minute interval, on average across all the days in the dataset,      
#    contains the maximum number of steps?
timeInterval<- unique(stepsPerInterval$interval[stepsPerInterval$byInterval==max(stepsPerInterval$byInterval)])

```
On average across all the days in the dataset, the 5-minute interval beginning at `timeInterval` contains the maximum number of steps.

## Imputing missing values
```{r, echo=TRUE, results="asis"}
# 1. Calculate and report the total number of missing values in the dataset (i.e. the total number of 
#    rows with 𝙽𝙰s)
lapply(activity, function(x) sum(is.na(x)))

# 2. Devise a strategy for filling in all of the missing values in the dataset. The strategy does not 
#    need to be sophisticated. For example, you could use the mean/median for that day, or the mean for 
#    that 5-minute interval, etc.

# Fills NAs with mean steps for interval
activity.fill <- activity[, stepsFilled:= ifelse(is.na(steps), byInterval,steps)]

# 3. Create a new dataset that is equal to the original dataset but with the missing data filled in.
activity.fill$date <-as.Date(activity.fill$date)
activity.fill$interval <-as.factor(activity.fill$interval)

activity.new <- data.table(cbind(activity.fill$stepsFilled, activity.fill$date, activity.fill$interval))
setnames(activity.new, c("steps","date", "interval"))
activity.new$date <-as.Date(activity.new$date)

head.activity.new <- xtable(as.data.frame(head(activity.new)))
print(head.activity.new, type="html")


#  4. Make a histogram of the total number of steps taken each day and calculate and report the mean 
#     and median total number of steps taken per day. Do these values differ from the estimates from 
#     the first part of the assignment? What is the impact of imputing missing data on the estimates 
#     of the total daily number of steps?

# Makes histogram of the total number of steps taken each day
stepsPerDay.new <- with(activity.new, tapply(steps, date, sum, na.rm=TRUE))
hist(stepsPerDay.new, 
        main = "Distribution of Total Number of Steps Per Day", 
        xlab="Steps Per Day", 
        ylab="Number of Days")
          
# Calculates and report the mean total number of steps taken per day
mean(stepsPerDay.new)

# Calculates and report the median total number of steps taken per day
median(stepsPerDay.new)

# Check whether means are the same
mean(stepsPerDay.new) == mean(stepsPerDay) 
meanSteps <- ifelse(mean(stepsPerDay.new) > mean(stepsPerDay), "higher", "lower" )

# Check whether means are the same
median(stepsPerDay.new) == median(stepsPerDay) 
medianSteps <- ifelse(median(stepsPerDay.new) > median(stepsPerDay) , "higher", "lower" )
```
The impact of imputing missing data makes the mean number of daily steps `r meanSteps`, and the median `r medianSteps`.


## Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?
```{r, echo=TRUE, results="asis"}
# 1. Create a new factor variable in the dataset with two levels – “weekday” and “weekend” indicating 
#    whether a given date is a weekday or weekend day.
activity.new[,weekday:=ifelse(grepl("Saturday|Sunday",weekdays(date)),"weekend", "weekday")]

# 2. Make a panel plot containing a time series plot (i.e. 𝚝𝚢𝚙𝚎 = "𝚕") of the 5-minute interval (x-
#    axis) and the average number of steps taken, averaged across all weekday days or weekend days 
#    (y-axis). See the README file in the GitHub repository to see an example of what this plot should 
#    look like using simulated data.

steps <- activity.new[, byInterval:= mean(steps, na.rm=TRUE), by=list(interval, weekday)]
b<- ggplot(steps, aes(x=interval, y=byInterval))
b+geom_line(lwd=1)+
        facet_grid(weekday~.)+
        ggtitle("Average Daily Activity Pattern Across Weekdays and Weekends")+
        labs(x="5-minute interval",y="Number of Steps")
